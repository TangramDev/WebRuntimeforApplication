 *
 * Web Runtime is a new, subversive and Internet Oriented Development Technology
 * for Windows Desktop Software. Its core idea is that, relying on the open-source
 * project of Chromium, developers are allowed to use their familiar software
 * development technology to realize the Main Process of their application system
 * as the Browser Process of Modern Web Browser. Because the Main Process is realized
 * by the developers themselves, the application system developed in this way is
 * completely different from modern web browser. This kind of application will
 * integrate the infrastructure of modern web browser as a part of the system model,
 * the application system contains not only the browser window inherent in the browser,
 * but also other desktop elements oriented to the application, such as WinForms, Java
 * and other mature software elements.
 *
 * There are Three Key Features of Webruntime:
 * 1. Built-in Modern Web Browser: Independent Browser Window and Browser Window
 *    as sub windows of other windows are supported in the application process;
 * 2. DOM Plus: DOMPlus is a natural extension of the standard DOM system.
 *    It allows the application system to support a kind of generalized web pages,
 *    which are composed of standard DOM elements and binary components supported
 *    by the application system;
 * 3. JavaScript for Application: Similar to VBA in MS office, JavaScript will
 *    become a built-in programmable language in the application system, so that
 *    the application system can be expanded and developed for the Internet based
 *    on modern javscript/Web technology.
 *
 * Built-in Full-Featured Modern Web Browser Subsystem
 *		Since the main process of the application system is essentially a Browser
 * Process, the application system can naturally create a new browser window. The
 * difference with standard browsers is that we allow the browser window to be a child
 * window of other windows. in sub-window model, we see a brand-new scene: a multi-tab
 * browser sub-window, we think this structure is more suitable for organizing specific
 * applications. Of course, the application system fully supports the creation of an
 * independent browser window as a part of the complete application system, and the browser
 * window serves as a natural extension of the ecological chain to ensure the richness
 * and diversity of the application system content.
 * DOM Plus:
 *		Because a large number of mature binary components that conform to industry
 * standards have formed a wealth of software asset accumulation, web runtime allows
 * developers to regard these existing accumulation as new DOM elements and then become
 * a part of web pages, this starting point eventually forms "DOM Plus". DOM plus is a
 * natural extension of standard DOM for desktop applications, similar to the extension
 * from "real number system" to "complex number system" in mathematical theory. Undoubtedly,
 * for the development of mathematics, from "real number system" to "complex number system"
 * is a huge leap, which can be said to be a decisive change in the development of modern
 * mathematics. We hope that the evolution from "DOM" to "DOM plus" will have a similar
 * effect, which is bound to be a huge change from desktop software to Internet desktop software.
 *		Different from earlier IE, based on the sandbox mechanism of Modern Web Browser,
 * we let these binary elements run in the Browser Process, completely isolated from the
 * Browser's Renderer Process. This makes full use of the security mechanisms of modern
 * browsers and also takes into account the accumulation of mature software component
 * technologies. Based on such considerations, existing development technologies such as
 * .NET, COM, Java, etc. can be fully applied to Internet software development.
