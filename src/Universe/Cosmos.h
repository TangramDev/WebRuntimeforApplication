 * Web Runtime is a new, subversive and Internet Oriented Development Technology
 * for Windows Desktop Software. Its core idea is that, relying on the open-source
 * project of Chromium, developers are allowed to use their familiar software
 * development technology to realize the Main Process of their application system
 * as the Browser Process of Modern Web Browser. Because the Main Process is realized
 * by the developers themselves, the application system developed in this way is
 * completely different from modern web browser. This kind of application will
 * integrate the infrastructure of modern web browser as a part of the system model,
 * the application system contains not only the browser window inherent in the browser,
 * but also other desktop elements oriented to the application, such as WinForms, Java
 * and other mature software elements.
 *
 * There are Three Key Features of Webruntime:
 * 1. Built-in Modern Web Browser: Independent Browser Window and Browser Window
 *    as sub windows of other windows are supported in the application process;
 * 2. DOM Plus: DOMPlus is a natural extension of the standard DOM system.
 *    It allows the application system to support a kind of generalized web pages,
 *    which are composed of standard DOM elements and binary components supported
 *    by the application system;
 * 3. JavaScript for Application: Similar to VBA in MS office, JavaScript will
 *    become a built-in programmable language in the application system, so that
 *    the application system can be expanded and developed for the Internet based
 *    on modern javscript/Web technology.
 *
 * Built-in Full-Featured Modern Web Browser Subsystem
 *		Since the main process of the application system is essentially a Browser
 * Process, the application system can naturally create a new browser window. The
 * difference with standard browsers is that we allow the browser window to be a child
 * window of other windows. in sub-window model, we see a brand-new scene: a multi-tab
 * browser sub-window, we think this structure is more suitable for organizing specific
 * applications. Of course, the application system fully supports the creation of an
 * independent browser window as a part of the complete application system, and the browser
 * window serves as a natural extension of the ecological chain to ensure the richness
 * and diversity of the application system content.
 * DOM Plus:
 *		Because a large number of mature binary components that conform to industry
 * standards have formed a wealth of software asset accumulation, web runtime allows
 * developers to regard these existing accumulation as new DOM elements and then become
 * a part of web pages, this starting point eventually forms "DOM Plus". DOM plus is a
 * natural extension of standard DOM for desktop applications, similar to the extension
 * from "real number system" to "complex number system" in mathematical theory. Undoubtedly,
 * for the development of mathematics, from "real number system" to "complex number system"
 * is a huge leap, which can be said to be a decisive change in the development of modern
 * mathematics. We hope that the evolution from "DOM" to "DOM plus" will have a similar
 * effect, which is bound to be a huge change from desktop software to Internet desktop software.
 *		Different from earlier IE, based on the sandbox mechanism of Modern Web Browser,
 * we let these binary elements run in the Browser Process, completely isolated from the
 * Browser's Renderer Process. This makes full use of the security mechanisms of modern
 * browsers and also takes into account the accumulation of mature software component
 * technologies. Based on such considerations, existing development technologies such as
 * .NET, COM, Java, etc. can be fully applied to Internet software development.

 * 
 * In the Internet era, because the web software model has broken through the 
 * limitations of local computers, this makes the software system based on 
 * Internet services popular and makes desktop software appear to be dwarfed. 
 * With the development of Internet technology, software content service is a 
 * key topic that many software infrastructures must face, this topic further 
 * highlights the dilemma of the current desktop software structure: on the one 
 * hand, a large number of software component assets have been formed, on the 
 * other hand, Internet services clearly represent the trend of software development. 
 * Therefore, how to properly adapt the desktop software to the development of 
 * the contemporary Internet is a very urgent problem and a basic problem that 
 * today's desktop software must face.
 * We know that the presentation of web software needs a modern web browser, an 
 * indisputable fact is that a desktop Internet web browser is also a desktop 
 * software, but because its content relies on Web pages, it is almost recognized 
 * as being out of the ranks of desktop software. In the age of the Internet, the 
 * difference between the Desktop Software System supported by binary components and 
 * the Browser Application Architecture supported by the content of Web pages has 
 * become more and more prominent, and it can be said that the two are gradually 
 * moving away. How Desktop Software finds its most suitable position has always been 
 * an interesting topic, but there has been no proper solution. Although CEF and Electron 
 * are very popular, they cannot fundamentally solve the key problem of desktop software 
 * connecting to the Internet. Web Runtime tries to consider this issue from a new 
 * perspective, due to the needs of Internet content security and rendering, Internet 
 * giants have formed a unique Sandbox-Based Multi-Process Architecture for the basic 
 * framework of the Web Browser, which makes the browser structure completely different 
 * from other desktop software systems in most cases. The Sandbox-Based Multi-Process 
 * Architecture indeed solves many problems caused by the Internet, and it also makes 
 * the Browser series and traditional desktop software form an increasingly clear difference. 
 * We believe that handling this difference is the key to solving the problem of Desktop 
 * Software adapting to the Internet.
 * If we take Web Browser as the smallest Desktop Software, for example, let's imagine 
 * that we use the basic structure of the Web Browser as the initial structure of other 
 * desktop software, what will happen? the problem will become clearer and clearer. We 
 * know that in modern browser architecture, the tasks of rendering and displaying web 
 * content are completed by the Render Process and GPU Process. The responsibility of 
 * the Browser Process seems to be to provide a content "viewport" for Web Content and 
 * "auxiliary facilities" around the web content, such as tab strip, toolbar, etc. The 
 * key to the difference between Desktop Software and Internet Web Browsers seems to be 
 * here. Since Chromium, Mozilla and other such types of projects only focus on the Browser 
 * Architecture itself, the restrictions that must be formed around the Browser Architecture 
 * also appear in Chromium, for example, because Chromium is a Browser Project, the 
 * implementation of the Browser Process is strictly limited to the C++ language level 
 * due to the project itself, from this we can see that the technical constraints on the 
 * browser process are one of the key reason to the huge difference between desktop software 
 * and browser software, if this constraint can be broken and developers are allowed to 
 * reconstruct the Browser Process while retaining the responsibility of the Browser Process, 
 * the situation will be completely different. According to this thinking principle, 
 * the problem will be how to use the existing Desktop Software Development Technology 
 * to reconstruct the Browser Process of Web Browser Multi-Process Architecture. This 
 * consideration seems to be a blind spot in the software industry today, since the vast 
 * majority of software teams believe that only the Browser Architecture requires the Process 
 * Separation of Browser, Renderer, GPU and others, this has led to a clear difference between 
 * the software structure of the browser team and the desktop software team. In order to 
 * fundamentally solve the basic problem of desktop software adapting to the Modern Internet, 
 * we should unify the core structure of the Browser Infrastructure and the Desktop Software 
 * Infrastructure. Recognizing this, the problem will become concise. We just need to consider, 
 * what conditions do developers need to build their own browser process?
 * Thanks to Google’s open-source project Chromium, we can compile the Browser Process 
 * Infrastructure of modern browsers into a set of dynamic link libraries, based on this, 
 * today’s developers are provided with a concise use of their familiar technical framework 
 * (such as .Net, Java) to construct their own Browser Process according to their own wishes, 
 * therefore a new desktop software construction mode appears.
