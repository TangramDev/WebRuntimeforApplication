 *           Web Runtime for Application - Version 1.0.0.202101240017
 ********************************************************************************
 * Copyright (C) 2002-2021 by Tangram Team.   All Rights Reserved.
 * There are Three Key Features of Webruntime:
 * 1. Built-in Modern Web Browser: Independent Browser Window and Browser Window
 *    as sub windows of other windows are supported in the application process;
 * 2. DOM Plus: DOMPlus is a natural extension of the standard DOM system.
 *    It allows the application system to support a kind of generalized web pages,
 *    which are composed of standard DOM elements and binary components supported
 *    by the application system;
 * 3. JavaScript for Application: Similar to VBA in MS office, JavaScript will
 *    become a built-in programmable language in the application system, so that
 *    the application system can be expanded and developed for the Internet based
 *    on modern javscript/Web technology.
